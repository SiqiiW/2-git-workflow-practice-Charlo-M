[Anyone can use this AI art generator — that’s the risk](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/15/23340673/ai-image-generation-stable-diffusion-explained-ethics-copyright-data)
- I was studying computer vision this semester. And the recent bloomings of generative ai caught my attention. Personaly I am amazed by the power of imagine ai - a prompt-based image generator.
- However, when I read this article, I started to ponder the paradox between the technology advancement and data protection. Copyright mentioned in the article is definitely one aspect. Or we could take a step further, who are there to protect our data or our behavior pattern? The concrete introduction of story behind stable diffusion is definitely worth reading.

 - This is an awesome article! I didn't know Stable Diffusion was open source before. 
 - The open-source nature of Stable Diffusion indeed means that Motasque and his colleagues "are not hoarding these new powers, but sharing them widely for anyone to use", but this is not good news on copyright protection. The more people contribute to it, the more difficult it is to find the party accountable for right violation.
 - Thank you for linking this informative article!
